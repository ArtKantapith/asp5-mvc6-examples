# Bootstrap ProgressBar component TagHelper

> In the last few blog posts, I have spent some time covering the tag helpers that are built in to MVC 6. While the built in tag helpers cover a lot of functionality needed for many basic scenarios, you might also find it beneficial to create your own custom tag helpers from time to time.

In this post, I will show how you can easily create a simple tag helper to generate a Bootstrap progress bar.
